# footprint model  definition
# each footprint is defined as a combination of multiple circles
#    if include model(s) is(are) defined, include circles will be added to it

#    only one include model supported in this version(for performance)

# model_num is fixed in 3, can't change in this version
# each layer description is also fixed, don't change
